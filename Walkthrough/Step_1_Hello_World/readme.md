This steps show how to create a simple Hello World! example with only HTML.

When this example is executed, "Hello World" text appear on the screen.

In this example, webapp folder is created, which will contain all the app files throughout this tutorial. This is the app folder.

index.html is the root file, and it has to be located in the app folder (webapp).

The index.html file consits of two sections: 
    - head, which is used by the browser to process the document using meta tagas to influence the beahavior of the browser, in this case UTF-8 character set. head also contains the title.
    - body, describes the layout of the page. In our case we simply display "Hello Workd" by using a div tag.
